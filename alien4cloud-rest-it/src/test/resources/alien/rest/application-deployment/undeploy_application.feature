Feature: Un-Deploy an application

  Background:
	Given I am authenticated with "ADMIN" role
	And I upload the archive "tosca-normative-types-wd06"
	And I upload a plugin
	And I create an orchestrator named "Mount doom orchestrator" and plugin id "alien4cloud-mock-paas-provider:1.0" and bean name "mock-orchestrator-factory"
	And I enable the orchestrator "Mount doom orchestrator"
	And I create a location named "Thark location" and infrastructure type "OpenStack" to the orchestrator "Mount doom orchestrator"
	And I create a resource of type "alien.nodes.mock.openstack.Flavor" named "Small" related to the location "Mount doom orchestrator"/"Thark location"
	And I update the property "id" to "1" for the resource named "Small" related to the location "Mount doom orchestrator"/"Thark location"
	And I create a resource of type "alien.nodes.mock.openstack.Image" named "Ubuntu" related to the location "Mount doom orchestrator"/"Thark location"
	And I update the property "id" to "img1" for the resource named "Ubuntu" related to the location "Mount doom orchestrator"/"Thark location"
	And I autogenerate the on-demand resources for the location "Mount doom orchestrator"/"Thark location"

	And There are these users in the system
	  | sangoku |
	And I add a role "APPLICATIONS_MANAGER" to user "sangoku"
	And I add a role "DEPLOYER" to user "sangoku" on the resource type "LOCATION" named "Thark location"
	And I am authenticated with user named "sangoku"

	And I pre register orchestrator properties
	  | managementUrl | http://cloudifyurl:8099 |
	  | numberBackup  | 1                       |
	  | managerEmail  | admin@alien.fr          |

  Scenario: Create 1 application, deploy it, check statuses, undeploy it and check statuses
	Given I have applications with names and descriptions and a topology containing a nodeTemplate "Compute" related to "tosca.nodes.Compute:1.0.0.wd06-SNAPSHOT"
	  | The great eye | This application should be in DEPLOYED status... |
	And I can get applications statuses
	When I deploy all applications on the location "Mount doom orchestrator"/"Thark location"
	Then I have expected applications statuses for "deployment" operation
	  | The great eye | DEPLOYED |

	When I undeploy all environments for applications
	Then I should receive a RestResponse with no error
	And I have expected applications statuses for "undeployment" operation
	  | The great eye | UNDEPLOYED |

	When I ask for detailed deployments for orchestrator "Mount doom orchestrator"
	Then I should receive a RestResponse with no error
	And the response should contains 1 deployments DTO and applications with an end date set
	  | The great eye |

  Scenario: Create 1 application, deploy it, undeploy it, disable the associate orchestrator and check the deployment topology
    Given I am authenticated with "ADMIN" role
    And I have applications with names and descriptions and a topology containing a nodeTemplate "Compute" related to "tosca.nodes.Compute:1.0.0.wd06-SNAPSHOT"
	  | The great eye | This application should be in DEPLOYED status... |
	When I deploy all applications on the location "Mount doom orchestrator"/"Thark location"
	And The application's deployment must succeed
	When I undeploy all environments for applications
	Then I should receive a RestResponse with no error
    And I disable "Mount doom orchestrator"
    Then I should receive a RestResponse with no error
    When I ask for the deployment topology of the application "The great eye"
	Then I should receive a RestResponse with no error
